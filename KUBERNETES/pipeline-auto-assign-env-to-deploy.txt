Let's break down how the YAML file works with the environment variable and how it interacts with the deploy.sh script:

1. Defining Parameters and Variables in the YAML:
yaml
Copy code
variables:
  environment: ${{ parameters.env }}
variables: This section defines the variables that will be used throughout the pipeline.
environment: ${{ parameters.env }}: The environment variable is assigned the value of parameters.env. The parameters.env is the value of the parameter that you define under parameters.

2. Defining the Parameter:
yaml
Copy code
parameters:
- name: env
  displayName: Environment
  type: string
  default: 'dev'
  values:
  - dev
  - test
  - uat
  - prod

parameters: This section defines parameters that users can select when they trigger the pipeline.
name: env: The name of the parameter is env.
displayName: Environment: This is the display name that will be shown to users in the UI.
type: string: The parameter is of type string.
default: 'dev': The default value for this parameter is 'dev'.
values:: This defines the list of acceptable values for the parameter, which include dev, test, uat, and prod.

3. How This Works Together:
Parameter Usage: When the pipeline is triggered, users can choose which environment they want to deploy to (dev, test, uat, or prod). If no value is selected, the pipeline defaults to 'dev'.

Variable Assignment: The selected environment value is then assigned to the environment variable in the variables section using ${{ parameters.env }}.

4. Passing the Environment Variable to the Script:
yaml
Copy code
steps:
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '$(azureSubscription)'
    scriptType: 'bash'
    scriptPath: 'scripts/deploy.sh'
    arguments: '$(environment)'

arguments: '$(environment)': This line passes the value of the environment variable (which is set to the selected environment) to the deploy.sh script.

5. Inside the deploy.sh Script:
In the deploy.sh script, you can capture the passed environment argument like this:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

ENVIRONMENT=$1  # Capture the first argument passed to the script
echo "Deploying to environment: $ENVIRONMENT"

# Example of using the environment variable
if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "dev" ]; then
  echo "Deploying to development environment..."
  # Add deployment logic here
elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "prod" ]; then
  echo "Deploying to production environment..."
  # Add deployment logic here
fi

$1: This is the first argument passed to the script, which corresponds to the environment variable from the pipeline.
Deployment Logic: The script can now use the value of ENVIRONMENT to determine what environment-specific logic to run.
Summary:
Parameters: Allow you to define a set of environments (dev, test, uat, prod) that can be selected when triggering the pipeline.
Variables: The selected parameter value is assigned to a variable environment.
Script Execution: This variable is passed to the deploy.sh script as an argument, allowing the script to handle the deployment logic based on the environment.
This setup ensures that your deployment pipeline is flexible, allowing easy selection and handling of different environments in a consistent manner.
